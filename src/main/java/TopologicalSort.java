     * Algorithm for Topological Sorting using DFS:
     * <p>
     * Hereâ€™s a step-by-step algorithm for topological sorting using Depth First Search (DFS):
     * <p>
     * Create a graph with n vertices and m-directed edges.
     * Initialize a stack and a visited array of size n.
     * For each unvisited vertex in the graph, do the following:
     * Call the DFS function with the vertex as the parameter.
     * In the DFS function, mark the vertex as visited and recursively call the DFS function for all unvisited neighbors of the vertex.
     * Once all the neighbors have been visited, push the vertex onto the stack.
     * After all, vertices have been visited, pop elements from the stack and append them to the output list until the stack is empty.
     * The resulting list is the topologically sorted order of the graph.
